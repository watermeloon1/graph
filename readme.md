## Graph visualizer in python

The project is a Python-based visualization tool that allows users to generate and rotate 3D graphs.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. To install Pygame, run the following command:
```shell
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:
```shell
python main.py
```
The program will open a window that displays a 3D graph. You can rotate the graph in any direction by clicking and dragging with your mouse.

## Development

The project is written in Python and uses Pygame for rendering. The source code is organized as follows:

- `main.py`: the main entry point of the application
- `application.py`: pygame logic and simulation iteration
- `camera.py`: handles the camera logic for rendering
- `cube.py`: shape class for example purposes
- `globe.py`: shape class for example purposes
- `sphere.py`: shape class for example purposes
- `graph.py`: contains the graph data structure and logic for rendering
- `node.py`: node class for elements in the graph
